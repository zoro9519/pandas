# Practical pandas projects

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a python library for doing exploratory data analysis.

There are [great docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) and [lots of online tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/tutorials.html) teaching the basics, but I've seen a lot of people asking what they can work on after they've gone through the tutorials.

My aim here is to create a list of project ideas that are exciting and practical.

Most projects include:

* An explanation of why the dataset is interesting
* Ideas for questions the data can answer
* A bit of sample data you can play with (in some cases)
* Instructions for how to get data

## The project ideas

* [Figure out which products sell best on Etsy](notebooks/etsy-listing-dataset.ipynb)

* Find freelance opportunities using Fiverr data
