    "# Find products to sell on Amazon\n",

    "I don't have a dataset for this idea, but I had to include it. There is a TON of interesting data analysis that you can do on Amazon and it can make you a lot of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon runs a service called FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) - this service allows people to ship products to Amazon's warehouse and sell through Amazon's website. If you can come up with a product that will sell on Amazon this can be a nice little business opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you find a product that will sell on Amazon? A company called [Jungle Scout](https://www.junglescout.com) has an approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their process involves:\n",
    "* Estimating how well a product is selling based on it's sales rank\n",
    "* Looking for products which are selling well but which don't have great reviews\n",
    "* Coming up with an improved version of these products to sell\n",
    "* Launching (and marketing) these products on Amazon\n",
    "\n",
    "They have a video series that explains their process far better than I ever could. I recommend checking it out for an inspiring look at how data analysis can help you build better products.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can crawl amazon listings. Collect the sales rank, product reviews and similar products to get a view into the market for a particular type of product.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an [Amazon Customer Reviews dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html) that Amazon provides... but I think this dataset is missing the interesting market salesrank data."
