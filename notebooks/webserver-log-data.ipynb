    "\n",
    "Ever wondered how Google Analytics works? It logs events - visits, clicks, sigunps, etc... and then aggregates them together and plots them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When companies grow (or when they have complicated reporting requirements) they often out-grow solutions like Google Analytics and end up having to roll their own solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work as a data analyst in a big tech company chances are you'll spend a lot of time writing queries that grab events from a database... group them into bins (maybe by month or something) and then plot them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in learning more about what enterprises are using these days I recommend checking out [Looker](https://looker.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bit of log data from a poetry community app that I run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try grouping events over time and plotting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideas for questions this data can help you answer\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many poems are being created per day?\n",
    "* How many poems are being deleted per day?\n",
    "* How are the stats trending over time?\n",
    "* Am I making any money (answer: no).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where you can go to get this kind of data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a webapp you're already generating this kind of data... it's all in your log files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Download a log file and go through it line by line. Simplify different kinds of requests down and give them names:\n",
    "signup, purchase, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "Load those events into a database and you've got a dataset like this one.\n",
